# FRR in Google Summer of Code
[Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/about/) is a yearly event where students from a diverse set of countries actively contribute to open source projects during their summer break away from classes. Google pays a stipend to these students to work with organizations selected by Google.

Students apply to the program and are selected by Google and FRR to work on a project over a three month period. Frr provides mentors to these students to help with community and technical guidance as they complete their respective projects.

## GSoC 2020

FRR is applying to be considered as an organization for the Google Summer of Code 2020. If selected as a participating organization, students will be able to apply to spend their summer enriching FRR through one of our available [projects](./year-2020/).
