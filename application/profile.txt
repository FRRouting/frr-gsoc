Description:
FRRouting (FRR) is an IP routing protocol suite for Linux and Unix platforms which includes protocol daemons for BGP, IS-IS, LDP, OSPF, PIM, PBR, RIP, BFD, Babel, OpenFabric, VRRP, EIGRP, and NHRP.

FRRâ€™s seamless integration with the native Linux/Unix IP networking stacks makes it applicable to a wide variety of use cases including connecting hosts/VMs/containers to the network, advertising network services, LAN switching and routing, Internet access routers, and Internet peering.

FRR is a high performance suite written primarily in C. It can easily handle full Internet routing tables and is suitable for use on hardware ranging from cheap SBCs to commercial grade routers. It is actively used in production by hundreds of companies, universities, research labs and governments.

A Linux Foundation Collaborative Project, FRR is distributed under GPLv2, with development modeled after the Linux kernel. Anyone may contribute features, bug fixes, tools, documentation updates, or anything else.

FRR is a fork of Quagga.
