If you have a project idea you'd like us to consider please discuss it with us on **#gsoc-2020** in slack then submit a PR on our GSoC [repo](https://github.com/FRRouting/frr-gsoc) with your project following the same style as the other projects here.

Students are also welcome to propose projects.

Discuss with us *as early as possible* if you would like to have one added.
